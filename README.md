## Map creation through semantic segmentation of aerial images using deep convolutional networks 

Train deep convolutional neural networks on aerial images and learn them to create maps.

Everything is built with Keras and Tensorflow backend. We have code for two networks:

FC-DenseNet https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326 and
U-Net https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
